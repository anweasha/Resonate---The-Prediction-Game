# Resonate---The-Prediction-Game

## Problem Statement
All of us love watching movies, a go-to for most people when they get bored. We all know that a lot of money goes into the making of a movie, so if it fares well at the box office there's nothing better than that. But if at all it turns out to be a flop movie, it's a huge setback for the entire team. Already, the current state of the world has led to millions of dollars worth of loss in the movie industry. Hence we have come up with a project that predicts the success outcome of a movie even before its production.

## Project Explanation
- In this project, we have attempted to predict if a movie is successful or not. A movie’s success can be interpreted in various ways. 
- First we have sorted the popularity of the movies on a year wise basis. Then we calculated the median of the column called ‘Popularity’. As such, the movies which have a popularity value greater than the popularity median are considered to be hit, whereas the others are considered to be flop. We have used deep learning and ANN for the same.
- For running the application the user has to input the names of 3 cast members, the director of the movie, genre, approximate runtime and tentative year of release as input for prediction.
- The system predicts whether the movie would be a hit or flop.
